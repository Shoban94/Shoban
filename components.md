# Components


As discussed in the paper \[[1](/references.md)\], this attack is possible in majority of the Android and iOS mobile phones. However the only phone used for demonstrating this attack is Samsung galaxy S5 as it was the only MHL compatible android phone with me.
The components used in this attack are the following: 

  1.	Samsung Galaxy S5 â€“ MHL Supported phone
  2.	VGA2USB convertor (Only supports MHL)
  3.	Epiphan VGA2USB Video grabber
  4.	VGA Male to Male convertor
  5.	Ubuntu System (Kernel version 4.10.0-28)
